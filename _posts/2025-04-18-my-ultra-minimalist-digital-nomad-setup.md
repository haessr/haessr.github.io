Step right up for a peek at my “office” — which alternates between a coffee shop, an Airbnb desk, and the occasional palm-shaded hammock. <!--more-->Spoiler: it’s delightfully low-maintenance.

## 🔧 My Setup


- **MacBook Air 13” M3**
  Light, silent, and absurdly fast. It runs my dev stack like a champ and vanishes in my backpack like a magician’s final trick.

- **Apple Magic Keyboard**
  Wireless, minimal, and so white it’s practically a lifestyle choice. My fingers float — and so does my soul.

- **Logitech MX Master 3S**
  Silky smooth, whisper quiet, and ergonomically elite. Scrolling through code has never felt this luxurious.

- **Powerbeats Pro 2**
  Stays in place through deep focus or deep squats. Great sound, zero wires, and a battery that outlasts my to-do list.

- **Native Union Desk Laptop Stand**
  Foldable, aluminum, and ergonomically enlightened. Also doubles as a conversation starter at cafés.

And that’s it. No dual-monitor monstrosity. No RGB lights trying to summon demons.
Just clean lines, clean code, and the occasional stray oat milk latte.

The less I carry, the more I move. And right now, I’m moving toward another sunny spot with decent Wi-Fi.

**Stay light, stay curious. 🌍**
