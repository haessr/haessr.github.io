Step right up for a peek at my “office” — which alternates between a coffee shop, an Airbnb desk, and the occasional palm-shaded hammock. <!--more-->Spoiler: it’s delightfully low-maintenance.

## 🔧 My Setup


- **MacBook Air 13” M3**
  Light, silent, absurdly fast. It handles my full dev stack without breaking a sweat — and vanishes into my backpack like a magician’s finale.

- **Apple Magic Keyboard**
  Minimal, wireless, and stylishly white. My fingers glide, my code flows, and I pretend I’m writing poetry.

- **Logitech MX Master 3S**
  The Rolls Royce of mice. Smooth, quiet, ergonomic — perfect for marathon coding sessions or scroll-heavy debugging.

- **Powerbeats Pro 2**
  Wireless, grippy, and with enough battery to outlast my workday. Great for deep focus and deep squats.

- **Native Union Desk Laptop Stand**
  Sleek, aluminum, and posture-saving. Bonus: looks cool enough to spark conversations with curious strangers.

And that’s it. No dual-monitor monstrosity. No RGB lights trying to summon demons.
Just clean lines, clean code, and the occasional stray oat milk latte.

The less I carry, the more I move. And right now, I’m moving toward another sunny spot with decent Wi-Fi.

**Stay light, stay curious. 🌍**
